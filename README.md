# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.
In this project:

1. Install Express program
2. Configure the first routes and controllers
3. Integrate Prettier
4. Create an entry point
5. Set up hot reload
6. Create a database with MongoDB connect it to the server
7. Create schemas and models,routes, controllers
8. Implement a temporary authorization solution
9. Create an authorization middleware
10. Handle errors (If something goes wrong with the request, you'll need to return an appropriate message, along with the corresponding error code).
11. Test your project with Postman and GitHub Actions

## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
